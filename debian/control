Description: Virtual network computing; Common software needed by clients and servers
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides the common
 software for both client and server.

Description: Virtual network computing server software
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a vncserver which uses screen scraping of an already
 running X server to provide its VNC desktop. The VNC desktop can be viewed
 by any vncviewer even on other operating systems.
 .
 Note: If you only want to scrap your local X11 server, you should consider
 the tigervnc-xorg-extension package. This package provides the vnc extension
 for your local X11 server. The usage of this extension is more efficient
 than a scraping vnc server.

 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a standalone vncserver to which X clients can connect.
 The server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 Note: This server does not need a display. You need a vncviewer to see
 something. This viewer may also be on a computer running other operating
 systems.

 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the

 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides a vncclient
 for X, with this you can connect to a vncserver somewhere in the network
 and display its content in a window. There are vncservers available for other
 operating systems.
