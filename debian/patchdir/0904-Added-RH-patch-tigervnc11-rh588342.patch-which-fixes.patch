Subject: [PATCH 4/7] Added RH patch tigervnc11-rh588342.patch which fixes EQ overflowing bug.

Xvnc could become unresponsive and the following error message was shown
in the log: "[mi] EQ overflowing. The server is probably stuck in an
infinite loop.". This was caused by a large number of user input events
in the Xvnc event queue, which were being processed too slowly. With
this update, this issue no longer occurs and the system works as
expected. (BZ#588342)
