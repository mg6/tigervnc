*** ABOUT GENERATING THE DEBS (SOURCE AND BINARY) ***

For a successful built of this package, three orig source tarballs are
needed:

- tigervnc_<tigervnc-version>+X<xorg-version>.orig.tar.gz
  This tarball is almost empty, only containing this README
- tigervnc_<tigervnc-version>+X<xorg-version>.orig-tigervnc.tar.gz
  This tarball contains the orig tarball for the VNC source code. This
  tarball corresponds to a checkout of the TigerVNC source code, e.g.,
  svn co http://tigervnc.svn.sourceforge.net/
  svnroot/tigervnc/tags/<tigervnc-version>
- tigervnc_<tigervnc-version>+X<xorg-version>.orig-xorg-server.tar.gz
  This tarball contains the orig tarball for the X server from
  www.x.org. Debian specific patches to the X server are not included in
  this tarball!

If you got this package via a git clone from Alioth, e.g., git clone
git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-tigervnc/pkg-tigervnc.git, then these orig
source tarballs are not included in the checkout.  However, all these
orig source tarballs are stored in pristine-tar format in the Alioth git
repositories, and can be acquired by executing: fakeroot debian/rules
get-orig-source.  Furthermore, the get-orig-source target will execute a
git submodule update --init, and thus populate the tigervnc and
xorg-server directories which were initially empty. The corresponding
source deb can then be built via dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -S. For a
built starting from the source deb, the get-orig-source target will no
longer be needed, as the tigervnc and xorg-xserver directories will be
populated via usage of the orig source tarballs.

*** ABOUT THE PATCH SYSTEM EMPLOYED ***

The patch system employed is multilayer, and hence comparatively complex.
The patch location/layers are as follows in sequence of application:

- debian/patches
  Used by the quilt 3.0 format. It mainly contains the patch to upgrade
  the tigervnc_<tigervnc-version>+X<xorg-version>.orig-xorg-server.tar.gz
  tarball (from x.org) to the debian version of the X server. The directory
  debian/patches is not included in the git tree, as it will be generated
  automatically by dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -S.
- xorg-server/debian/patches
  The xorg-server/debian directory will be generated by the previous patch
  layer. It contains the debian patches to the xorg tree. The debian/rules
  of the pkg-tigervnc will trigger the patching process of the xorg tree
  to get the xorg tree with debian patches applied. The patches in this
  directory are controlled by the debian X strike force.
- debian/xserver.patch
  This is a symlink to a xorg tree patch provided by the upstream tigervnc
  project. This patch add the VNC extension for the xorg tree.
- debian/patchdir
  Another quilt patch directory. This directory contains our patches to fix
  various shortcomings in the VNC and xorg source code. If you modify code
  you should add your patches into that directory, as the previous three
  patch layers are controlled by foreign parties.
